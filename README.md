# kyt
A development kit for Node-React Apps

## What is kyt?
kyt is a dev tool created to let teams build node-react apps without having to manage any configuration.

## Setup

### Requirements

There are 2 basic requirements:

1. A `package.json`. The more "plain vanilla" it is, the better. For best results, start with a fresh `npm init`.

2. Node v6 is required. You can install/manage versions of node using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):

```
nvm install 6
```

Or, if you already have it

```
nvm use 6
```

### Install kyt

```
npm install -S git+git@github.com:nytm/wf-kyt.git
```

kyt will modify your `package.json` to add the necessary npm scripts and test configuration for you.
